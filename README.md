## 🎯 Mock Analysis Logic

The application uses a simulated analysis engine that:

- Identifies synonym matches (e.g., "JS" matches "JavaScript")
- Calculates ATS compatibility score
- Generates realistic evaluations and recommendations

**Note**: This is a frontend-only demonstration. In a production environment, you would integrate with a backend AI service for actual resume parsing and analysis.
